This is the official github repository for the Collector's Hub Bot used in the [Collector's Hub](https://discord.gg/collectors) Discord server.

The bot is made to be semi-modular, so that you can configure it to your own server. That being said, this is not likely to be something you use rather than take code from.

Please note that some parts of this bot are made pretty badly. `modules/parser.py` is especially bad in retrospect and I will likely redo it at some point.

I would also like to ask that, should you decide to find bugs in the bot via the github repo, that you report them directly to @ragingenby on Discord, rather than a public issue.
